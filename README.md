# Task-Fragmentation

AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragment the UI into selective components to make it more readable

# My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that
Fragmenting the UI into selective components is a best practice in React development. It enhances readability, reusability, scalability, and testability, leading to a more efficient and maintainable codebase. By adopting this approach, developers can build robust and flexible applications that are easier to maintain and extend over time. Individuals proficient in UI fragmentation and component-based architectures demonstrate strong problem-solving skills and contribute significantly to the success of software projects.
